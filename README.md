Vibrotactile Scale Multidimensional

Repository for experimental design, implementation, and analysis of multidimensional vibrotactile scales based on psychophysical methods.

This project investigates the construction of vibrotactile scales grounded in perceptual thresholds (absolute limits, JNDs, and terminal limits) and their combination into bi- and three-dimensional arrangements.

Contents

ðŸ”¹ Source code for vibrotactile devices (Arduino/ESP32)

ðŸ”¹ Experimental protocols for perceptual tasks (identification, ordering, pairwise comparison)

ðŸ”¹ Datasets and user study results

ðŸ”¹ Scripts for statistical analysis and visualization

Goals

The main objective is to provide a methodological and technical foundation for designing vibrotactile encodings that are:

Perceptually grounded

Robust and scalable

Applicable to data representation, humanâ€“computer interaction, and accessibility
